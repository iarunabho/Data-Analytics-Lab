 # Data Analytics Lab experiments

1.Perform descriptive analysis on EmployeeAttrition dataset - Program is running
2.Perform web scrapping on PSG Tech website.  
3. Use MovieGenre dataset to perform image processing
4. Text processing
5. Linear regression
6. Create a training model using ANN for the movie dataset/Iris dataset. Class label is movie rating. Find the accuracy of your algorithm using 10-fold cross validation and leave-once cross validation
7. Perform classification using NaiveBayes and SVM on Iris dataset. Display the confusion matrix for the various classifiers. Analyze the performance of SVM for different kernel functions. Represent the results of the classification in terms of precision and recall using graphs.
8. Perform clustering (k-means, k-medoids and agglomerative: single, complete and average linkage).
